<p>With a smartphone in one hand, pen and paper in the other and a voice recorder in her pocket, Eve holds a dual role at <a href="https://wearesnook.com">Snook</a>, working on communications and research. Eve often refers to the question ‘if technology is the answer, what was the question?’ In her spare time, Eve helps out human rights organisations with the translation of court cases and communications support.</p>
