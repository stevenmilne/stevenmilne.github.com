<h1>Sponsorship opportunities</h1>

<p>We expect around 100 people at the conference.</p>

<p>Every penny of the sponsorship raised will be used to help with conference costs, mainly venue costs, speaker expenses and catering for attendees. </p>

<p>We run a tight ship, and keep our costs to a minimum. Everyone involved in organising Northern Lights works on a voluntary basis.  We work hard to keep individual ticket prices as low as we can to encourage the widest attendance possible.</p>
<p> Tickets for Northern Lights 2019 are just £25 including refreshments through the day and a great lunch. Student tickets covering lunch and refreshments are £10. </p>

<p>Sponsors are essential to the continued success of Northern Lights, we’d be delighted to have you on board at any level.</p>
<p>To make life easier we're trying out a new approach. This means you can pay for sponsorship on the booking form (available later). Just email me to let me know who you want to send along on your guest tickets, or who needs parking for the day. Please <a href="mailto:b.scharlau@abdn.ac.uk">get in touch</a> if you have any questions, we’d love to hear from you, and we hope to see you in November.</p>

<p>We have also introduced a <a href="/codeofconduct/">code of conduct</a> this year. We expect all participants to follow this: attendees, speakers and sponsors. As before, get in touch if you have any questions.</p>
