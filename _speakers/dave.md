<p>Dave is a hacker and an engineer driven by curiosity and excitement. During the day, he works as a telecoms project engineer in oil & gas. By night, he takes things apart, stares at their innards and usually fails to put them back together properly.</p>

<p>Dave is totally committed to growing hacker and maker culture, and is taking an active role in Aberdeenâ€™s local hackerspace, <a href="https://57north.co/">57North</a>, to help provide others opportunities for learning, excitement and life changing experiences that these social spaces offer.</p>
