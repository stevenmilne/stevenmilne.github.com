### Building the right tool for the job

<p class="lead"> 
It's important to build the right tools to allow people to think about WHAT they are doing instead of HOW they are doing it. What are the benefits of automation. Productivity, consistency, accuracy... and how the best way to achieve this is via simplicity.  </p>

### About Maria

<p class="lead">Maria has been building software for 13 years for a number of different industries. The most satisfying part of her work has been building tools that improve the lives of users! </p>

Maria works at LivingSocial where she builds products that help merchants to engage new customers. In a previous position with Adobe Systems, Maria built tools and contributed to the SDK that enabled developers to extend Creative Suite applications.
