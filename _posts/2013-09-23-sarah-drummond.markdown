Sarah will be talking about Do-tanks for government, living life in perpetual beta and being comfortable with the unknown.  </p>

### About Sarah

<p class="lead">Sarah is the co-founder and Director of Design at [Snook](http://wearesnook.com/snook/), a Glasgow based social innovation outfit working with the public, private and third sector to rethink the way people live.</p>
