### Presentations from beginner to not so beginner

<p class="lead">One of the most dreaded things for most people is giving a presentation. It is an essential tool in business, a way to get things done, get people to work with you and share ideas. However it is a skill that requires time and practice and the conquering of the dreaded nerves factor.</p>

This session will hopefully help you with some of the common mistakes that speakers can make.  We will look at ways to prepare your session, practicing your talk and how to identify weak spots in your presentation so that you can get better as a technical presenter.

This talk is aimed at people who would like to try presenting or are already doing it and want to get better.
