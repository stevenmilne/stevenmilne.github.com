        <p>The 4th Northern Lights Conference took place place on Friday, 17 October in the auditorium of historic Kingâ€™s College, Aberdeen. Huge thanks to everyone that came and shared their experiences through the day.</p>

        <p>Northern Lights is always a little different, this year was no exception. We had an exciting programme of speakers, a terrific response to our open space sessions, and our biggest turn out yet.</p>
        <p>Our move to the auditorium, and the fact that the <a href="http://codethecity.org">CodeTheCity</a> civic hacking weekend kicking off the following day made for a great day.</p>
