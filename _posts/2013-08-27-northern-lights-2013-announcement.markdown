We are delighted to announce the date for Northern Lights 2013 - 18th October 2013.

We have a great line up which will be announced over the coming weeks, and some exciting new additions to the programme. Tickets remain at £15, with supporter packages at £100. This is a conference organised by the local community, for the local community.

I would encourage local companies working with technology to show their support for the local tech community and consider becoming supporters. /supporters
