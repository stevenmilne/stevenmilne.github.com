<h1>Sponsorship opportunities</h1>

<p>At our last conference we welcomed just short of 100 people to the conference.</p>

<p>Every penny of the sponsorship raised will be used to help with conference costs, mainly venue costs, speaker expenses and catering for attendees. </p>

<p>We run a tight ship, and keep our costs to a minimum. Everyone involved in organising Northern Lights works on a voluntary basis.  We work hard to keep individual ticket prices as low as we can to encourage the widest attendance possible.</p>
<p> Tickets for Northern Lights 2016 are just £18 including refreshments through the day and a great lunch. Student tickets covering lunch and refreshments are £8. </p>

<p>Sponsors are essential to the continued success of Northern Lights, we’d be delighted to have you on board at any level.</p>
<p>To make life easier we're trying out a new approach. This means you can pay for sponsorship on the <a href="http://www.store.abdn.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&modid=2&deptid=50&catid=23&prodid=276">booking form</a>. Just email me to let me know who you want to send along on your guest tickets, or who needs parking for the day. Please <a href="mailto:b.scharlau@abdn.ac.uk">get in touch</a> if you have any questions, we’d love to hear from you, and we hope to see you in October.</p>

<p>We have also introduced a <a href="/codeofconduct/">code of conduct</a> this year. We expect all participants to follow this: attendees, speakers and sponsors. As before, get in touch if you have any questions.</p>
