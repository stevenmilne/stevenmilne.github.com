### Interactive Print

<p class="lead">My vision is to add interactivity to any piece of print or any everyday object around us.  I have spent the last few years creating a platform using conventional electronics and traditional print which can add this interactivity using readily available manufacturing process.</p>

In my talk I will describe some of the things we can create, posters, books, walls, tables and cardboard boxes can make music talk to you or connect to the Internet, we have a lot of fun! :)</p>
 

### About Kate

<p class="lead">As a child I was fascinated with putting electronics into objects around us. After this dream faded 

away I spent several years travelling around Asia and Australia, aquiring some of my greatest 

lessons in resourcefulness and making the most of the path and people in front of me.</p>

My desire to learn more about electronics resurfaced so I returned to the UK to study for a degree followed quickly by a PhD in physics at Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory where I moved electrons around one by one, it was electronics at its most simple level! After spending four years in a Cambridge startup I began my new adventure with a company of my own. It has recently become obvious that the work of my team and myself is the realization of my childhood fascinations, we put electronics into paper, and paper is all around us.
