At previous Northern Lights we've always had panels. Panels are great, they let the audience know what the panel think about a wider set of topics than just their talk. They let the audience ask questions of the panel and have their say on the discussion topics.

We've even ensured that audience members can have opportunity to become part of the panel.

The participation of everyone at the conference is important to us, so this year we're going further. The panels are gone - replaced with an open space experiment to deliver varied, high quality, attendee led discussions to Northern Lights.

Over an extended lunchtime break in talks we're facilitating an unconference style open space discussion. All attendees can propose topics, cluster around areas of interest, and share thoughts and experiences.

Northern Lights is at its best when the attendees communicate with speakers and each other. So we've put that at the heart of the day.
