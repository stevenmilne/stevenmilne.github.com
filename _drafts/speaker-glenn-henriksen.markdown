## Leading without formal authority

<p class="lead">Are you dependent on other people in your job? Do you ever need to get people outside your department on-board to your idea? Do you want to get others in your organization to prioritize your work? Without having the formal authority to do so? </p>

I'll show you techniques and structure you can use to lead people effectively without having formal line authority. And it's all geared towards situations developers might find themselves in!


## About Glen

<p class="lead">Glenn F. Henriksen is currently working as a development technical lead at EVRY, Norway's biggest IT-company. </p>

Here he gets to explore new tools, processes and technologies and continuously improve how he and his fellow developers work with code, tasks and projects. He's been swapping code for food for some 15 years and is still loving it!
